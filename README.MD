## SemCache - Semantic Caching for LLM Applications

SemCache is an open-source semantic cache microservice for LLM applications. SemCache is aimed at advanced LLM application developers looking for a secure, performant semantic cache for their applications.


## Why Use SemCache?
SemCache abstracts away the complexity of semantic cache by packing the configuration of the database and API routes into a simple endpoint. 

### When to use SemCache
SemCache fills the need for lightweight tools that provide core functionality without the bloat of the existing libraries. SemCache is built with cloud native deployments in mind.

## Endpoints
